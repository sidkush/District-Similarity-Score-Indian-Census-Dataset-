## Introduction

This project analyzes the 2011 India Census data to gain insights into urbanization trends and demographic patterns across different districts in India. The census data provides a comprehensive view of the population, including information on literacy, employment, household characteristics, and more.

## Prerequisites

To run this analysis, you need:

- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/india-census-analysis.git
cd india-census-analysis

2. Install the required Python libraries:

3. Download the dataset:
- Ensure you have the `india-districts-census-2011.csv` file in the project directory.

## Business Problem Statement

The main objectives of this analysis are:

1. To understand the urbanization trends across different districts in India.
2. To analyze demographic patterns, including population distribution, literacy rates, and workforce participation.
3. To identify correlations between various socio-economic factors and urbanization.
4. To provide insights that can aid in policy-making and urban planning.

## Methodology

The analysis follows these steps:

1. Data Loading: Import the census data from the CSV file.
2. Data Exploration: Examine the structure and content of the dataset.
3. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and inconsistencies if any.
4. Descriptive Analysis: Calculate summary statistics and create visualizations.
5. Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships between different variables.
6. Geospatial Analysis: Visualize data on maps to identify regional patterns.

## Code Structure

The Jupyter Notebook `Urbanisation.ipynb` contains the following main sections:

1. Importing Libraries
2. Loading the Data
3. Data Exploration
4. Data Analysis and Visualization

## Running the Code

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
2. Open the `Urbanisation.ipynb` file in the Jupyter Notebook interface.

3. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially.

## Solution and Approach

The code solves the business problem through the following approach:

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing:**
- The census data is loaded using pandas, allowing for efficient data manipulation.
- Basic data exploration is performed to understand the structure and content of the dataset.

2. **Descriptive Statistics:**
- Summary statistics are calculated to provide an overview of key demographic indicators.
- This helps in understanding the overall trends in population, literacy, and workforce participation.

3. **Data Visualization:**
- Various charts and graphs are created using matplotlib and seaborn to visualize trends and patterns.
- These visualizations make it easier to identify urbanization trends across different districts.

4. **Geospatial Analysis:**
- The code attempts to use mpl_toolkits.basemap for creating map visualizations, although there seems to be an issue with importing this library in the provided code snippet.
- When properly implemented, this would allow for the creation of thematic maps showing regional variations in urbanization and other demographic factors.

5. **Correlation Analysis:**
- While not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the imported libraries suggest that correlation analysis between different socio-economic factors could be performed.
